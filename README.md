# Simple asynchronous Python client for IRCEL - CELINE open data

**Work in progress**

Python module to get data from the [IRCEL - CELINE open data](https://irceline.be/en/documentation/open-data)

Target features:

- [X] Get data for real time measurements interpolated
- [X] Get forecast data for PM10, PM2.5 and O3
- [X] Compute or fetch BelAQI index (observation and forecast)
- [ ] Maybe: also provide data from the stations and not only interpolation
